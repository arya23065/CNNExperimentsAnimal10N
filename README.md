# Animal Identification with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Introduction
I trained 3 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including a basic CNN designed from scratch, ResNet-18 trained from scratch, and a version ResNet-18 pre-trained on ImageNet, to determine which CNN yields the most accurate and precise animal identification, on the ANIMAL-10N dataset consisting of 5 confusing pairs of animal classes. 

## Experiments
After training, various experiments were performed on the models to learn about their abilities and the impacts of transfer learning on such tasks, using each neural network's top-1 classification accuracy, precision and recall. Its classification patterns were quantified using Confusion Matrices and its features were visualized and evaluated qualitatevely using Saliency Maps.
